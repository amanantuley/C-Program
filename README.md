## 📝 **About the Repository**  

This repository includes two projects built using the C programming language:  
- **ATM Machine Simulator**: A simulation of an ATM machine that allows users to check balance, withdraw funds, and deposit money.  
- **Quiz Game**: An interactive command-line quiz game that asks a set of questions and keeps track of the user's score.

These projects highlight core C programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, functions, and arrays.

## 📂 **Projects Included**  

### 1. **ATM Machine Simulator**  
- A simple ATM simulation that lets users log in, check their balance, withdraw money, and deposit funds.  
- The ATM uses basic file handling to simulate account data storage.  
- Key features:  
  - Account login using PIN.  
  - Balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal functions.  
  - Basic security features like PIN validation.  

### 2. **Quiz Game**  
- An interactive multiple-choice quiz game that asks questions and displays correct answers based on the user’s responses.  
- The game keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback after each question.  
- Key features:  
  - Randomized questions and answers.  
  - Scoring system.  
  - Feedback and result display.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**  

- **C Programming Language**: Main language used for both projects.  
- **GCC Compiler**: For compiling and running the C programs.  
- **File Handling**: Used in the ATM project for simulating account data storage.
